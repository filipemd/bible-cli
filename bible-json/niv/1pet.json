        "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,",
        "who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.",
        "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,",
        "and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,",
        "who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.",
        "In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.",
        "These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith —of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire —may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.",
        "Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,",
        "for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.",
        "Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,",
        "trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow.",
        "It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.",
        "Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming.",
        "As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.",
        "But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;",
        "for it is written: \"Be holy, because I am holy.\" [^1]",
        "Since you call on a Father who judges each person's work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear.",
        "For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors,",
        "but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.",
        "He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.",
        "Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.",
        "Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart. [^2]",
        "For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.",
        "For, \"All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,",

        "you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house \"to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.",
        "For in Scripture it says: \"See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" [^2]",

        "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.",

        "Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.",
        "Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.",
        "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority,",
        "or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.",
        "For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.",
        "Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God's slaves.",
        "Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.",
        "Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.",
        "For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God.",
        "But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.",

        "\"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" [^5]",
        "When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.",
        "\"He himself bore our sins\" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; \"by his wounds you have been healed.\"",

        "Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.",
        "Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.",
        "For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands,",
        "like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.",
        "Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.",

        "They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.",

        "But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. \"Do not fear their threats \"; do not be frightened.\" [^3]",

        "keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.",
        "For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.",

        "After being made alive, \"he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits —",
        "to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water,",
        "and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also —not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. \"It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,",

        "As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.",
        "For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do —living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.",
        "They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you.",
        "But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.",
        "For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.",
        "The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.",

        "If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.",
        "However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.",
        "For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?",
        "And, \"If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?\" [^1]",
