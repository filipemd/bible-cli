        "As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer",
        "or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God's work —which is by faith.",
        "The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.",
        "Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk.",
        "They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.",

        "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service.",
        "Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.",
        "The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.",
        "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners —of whom I am the worst.",
        "But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.",
        "Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.",

These are the things you are to teach and insist on.",
