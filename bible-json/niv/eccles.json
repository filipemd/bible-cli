        "Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.",
        "Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind.",
        "For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil."
